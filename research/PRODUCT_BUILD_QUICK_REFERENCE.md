## IMMEDIATE TAKEAWAYS

### What Works: Steal These Ideas

#### 1. Naming Convention System
```
[Design Name] + [Fit Type] + [Color/Variant]

Examples:
- Vandal Relaxed Tee in Olive
- Alpha Cross Embroidered Boxy Tee in Red
- Zodiac Relaxed Polo
```
**Why it works:** Creates collectability, signals fit without trying on, enables variant scaling.

#### 2. Price Tier Architecture
```
Entry (20%):    ₹2,500-4,000   Caps, beanies, basic tees
Core (50%):     ₹4,500-7,500   Graphics, embroidery, polos
Premium (25%):  ₹8,000-14,000  Shirts, sweaters, jackets
Hero (5%):      ₹15,000+       Hand-made, limited, artisanal
```

#### 3. Store Language
- Don't call them "stores" → Call them "Chapters"
- Don't say "Shop Now" → Say "Discover"
- Don't say "New Collection" → Say "New Drop"
- Don't say "Customers" → Say "Community"

#### 4. Physical Space Strategy
- Non-mall locations (creative compounds, warehouse districts)
- Limited hours (12pm-8pm = evening crowd)
- Community event function (not just retail)
- Stockist network for reach without dilution
